//! Welcome to Rust workshop
//! ------------------------
//! 
//! It consists into a list of "crates" (packaging name in Rust). Your goal is to make test passes using `cargo test`. You start with [01-basic](../01_basic/index.html), and when you're done, go to [02-control](../02_control/index.html) and continue this way until the end ! All code to touch are in `/src/tests.rs` files.
